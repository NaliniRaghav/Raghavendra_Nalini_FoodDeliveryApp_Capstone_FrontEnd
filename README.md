Technologies Used:

 MongoDB: Used as the database to store user data, restaurants, and order history. Express: Serves as the backend framework, handling APIs and authentication.
 React: Provides a dynamic and responsive user interface with reusable components. Node.js: Manages the server, processes requests, and interfaces with MongoDB.
Packages Used Backend (Node.js & Express)
 1. Express: Simplifies routing and server setup. 
2. Mongoose: Manages MongoDB data models with schemas and easy-to-use query methods.
 3. dotenv: Loads environment variables securely from a .env file. 
4. CORS: Allows the frontend and backend to communicate securely by handling cross-origin requests.
Frontend (React) 
1. React Router: Handles routing between multiple pages within the application.
 2. Axios: Simplifies HTTP requests for interacting with backend APIs. 
3. React Hooks: Manages state and lifecycle methods across components
. 4. CSS Modules: Provides component-scoped CSS to manage styling and avoid conflicts.

Application Structure 

The FoodOnTheFly project is organized into two main directories: backend and frontend. Backend The backend directory houses the server-side logic and data handling. Inside the index.js is responsible for setting up the database connection configuration for MongoDB. The FoodOntheFly_Db is the name of the database.
The .env file stores environment variables, such as database URIs and secret keys. Finally, index.js is the main server file that initializes and runs the backend server.

 The installation and route details used in the project are available in the README.md file under the folder  Nalini_Raghavendra_Capstone_BackEnd. 
Frontend The frontend directory contains the client-side interface built with React. 
The public folder includes static assets accessible to the client.
 Inside src, the components folder holds reusable UI components.

The pages folder stores the main pages of the application: 
LoginPage.jsx presents the login interface. 
SignupPage.jsx allows new users to register.
 ResetPasswordPage.jsx enables password reset functionality. 
RestaurantDisplay.jsx shows a list of available restaurants. 
MenuItemDisplay.jsx displays the menu items for a selected restaurant. 
App.jsx serves as the main React application, routing and orchestrating the components. 
main.jsx is the entry point that renders the React application in the browser. 
The projectâ€™s documentation, guidelines, and setup instructions are outlined in the README.md file at the root level, providing a comprehensive overview of the application and its components.
